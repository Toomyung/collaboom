I need your help debugging a critical Supabase Auth issue.
Please read carefully and reason step by step.

Context:
- This is a production app deployed on Render.
- Frontend + backend are using Supabase for DB + Google OAuth.
- Supabase plan is FREE.
- The app URL is https://collaboom.onrender.com
- OAuth redirect target is /auth/callback on that domain.

Problem:
Google OAuth login completely fails BEFORE reaching Google.
The browser fails to even load the Supabase auth endpoint.

This is the exact URL being opened:
https://ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co/auth/v1/authorize?provider=google&redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fcollaboom.onrender.com%2Fauth%2Fcallback

Browser error:
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN

Critical observation:
The Supabase project domain itself does NOT resolve at the DNS level.

I tested locally on my machine:

nslookup ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co 8.8.8.8
→ NXDOMAIN

nslookup ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co 1.1.1.1
→ NXDOMAIN

curl -I https://ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co/auth/v1/health
→ Could not resolve host

This means:
- The domain ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co does not exist or is not reachable globally.
- This is NOT a redirect mismatch, NOT a Google Console issue, and NOT a frontend routing issue.

What I already verified:
1) Supabase dashboard → Settings → Data API → Project URL shows:
   https://ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co

2) Render environment variables:
   SUPABASE_URL = https://ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = sb_publishable_...
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL = same
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = same

3) Google Cloud Console:
   - Authorized JS origins include:
     https://collaboom.io
     https://ltcfqwtlmtychuntnpqs.supabase.co
   - Redirect URI is correctly set.

4) Supabase project is NOT paused (checked Project availability).

Important note:
Supabase status page currently shows Auth issues related to SMTP emails,
but this issue happens BEFORE email or OAuth consent.
This is a DNS-level failure.

What I need from you:
- Based on this information, do you think this Supabase project is in a broken / orphaned state?
- Is this something that can happen on Free plans (project URL not resolving)?
- From a practical standpoint, is the fastest fix:
  A) Recreate a new Supabase project and migrate
  B) Change any infrastructure/config I missed
  C) Something else you recommend

Please do NOT give generic Supabase setup instructions.
I need a concrete diagnosis and recommended next action.
