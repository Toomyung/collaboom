PROMPT START

You are working on an existing, already-deployed product called Collaboom.

Your task is to create documentation only.
You must NOT modify code, database schema, or configuration in any way.

Context (Must Read First)

The system already has a baseline PRD:
📄 docs/prd/PRD-Campaigns-and-Applications.md

This document defines:

Campaigns

Applications

Application states

Admin vs Creator responsibilities

This task is to create PRD #2, which focuses on:
Upload submission, verification, and deadline handling

The system is in late development / early production.

Real users may already exist

Stability and operational safety are critical

Output File (Strict)

Create the following file ONLY:

docs/prd/PRD-Upload-Verification-and-Deadlines.md

Do NOT create or modify any other files.

Goal of PRD #2

This PRD must clearly define operational rules for:

How creators submit upload proof

How admins verify or reject submissions

How deadlines are enforced

What happens when creators fail to upload

Which states are considered terminal

What actions are allowed or forbidden after terminal states

This area is the highest operational risk zone of the platform and must be explicit.

Absolute Rules (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ Do NOT modify or suggest code changes
❌ Do NOT change database schema or enums
❌ Do NOT invent brand-new concepts unrelated to existing behavior
❌ Do NOT contradict PRD #1

✅ Use PRD #1 as the source of truth for application states
✅ If something is unclear, mark it clearly as Assumption
✅ If a decision is needed later, mark it as Decision Needed

Writing Language & Style

Write the PRD in English

Use simple, explicit English

Prefer bullet points over long paragraphs

Assume the reader is:

A developer

An operator

Or an AI agent implementing logic strictly

This is not marketing copy.
This is a system rules document.

Required Sections (Must Include All)
1. Purpose & Scope

Why upload verification exists

Why this process must be strict

How it connects to Application states defined in PRD #1

2. Terminology

Define clearly:

Upload Submission

Verification

Deadline

Resubmission

Terminal State

3. User Roles & Allowed Actions
Creator Actions (No direct state mutation)

Submit upload proof

View verification status

Resubmit (if allowed)

View deadline information

Explicitly state what creators cannot do.

Admin Actions

Review submission

Approve submission

Reject submission

Request resubmission (if applicable)

Mark deadline missed (manual or automatic)

4. Upload Submission Requirements

Define what is required for verification readiness.

Include differences by campaign type:

Gifting

Link-in-bio

Amazon video upload

For each type, clarify:

What kind of link or proof is required

What makes a submission invalid

5. Verification Workflow

Define the step-by-step flow:

Submission received

Verification pending

Approved / Rejected

Optional resubmission

Clarify:

Whether multiple resubmissions are allowed

Who decides final approval

What happens after approval

6. Deadlines & Time-Based Rules

Define:

Upload deadline

Grace period (if any)

Automatic vs manual deadline handling

Admin override rules (if allowed)

Clearly state:

What happens when the deadline is missed

Which state the application moves to

7. Terminal States & Locking Rules

Define which states are terminal, such as:

completed

rejected

deadline_missed / expired

For terminal states:

Explicitly state that no further mutations are allowed

Clarify which actions are blocked

8. Failure & Edge Cases

Cover scenarios such as:

Invalid or broken links

Private or deleted content

Submission after deadline

Content changed after approval

Long verification delays

9. Operational Safety Rules

Include rules like:

No payout before verification approval

No verification without submission

No state rollback after terminal state

(This section defines “things we must never allow”)

10. Assumptions & Open Questions

List:

Any assumptions made due to unclear implementation

Any decisions that must be confirmed later

These must be clearly labeled.

11. Relation to Future PRDs

Briefly explain that:

Payout and settlement logic will be defined in PRD #3

This PRD intentionally stops before financial execution

Final Instructions

Generate the PRD as a complete, readable document

Do not reference this prompt in the output

Do not include implementation code

Do not modify any existing files

This PRD should be suitable to act as a baseline reference

After completing the file, stop.
