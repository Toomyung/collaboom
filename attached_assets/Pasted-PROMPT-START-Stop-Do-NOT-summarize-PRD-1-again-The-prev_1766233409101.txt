PROMPT START

Stop. Do NOT summarize PRD #1 again.

The previous output repeated Campaign and Application definitions.
That is NOT the goal.

What You Must Do Now

Create PRD #2, which is a procedural, operational rules document.

This document is NOT about:

Campaign types

Application state lists

Payout systems

Score or tier systems

Those already belong to PRD #1.

Scope of PRD #2 (VERY IMPORTANT)

PRD #2 is ONLY about:

Upload submission

Verification workflow

Deadlines

Failure handling

Terminal state locking rules

If a section does not directly relate to one of the above,
DO NOT include it.

Output File (Strict)

Create or overwrite ONLY:

docs/prd/PRD-Upload-Verification-and-Deadlines.md

Do NOT touch any other file.

Rules You Must Follow

Use PRD #1 as the baseline reference

Do NOT redefine campaign or application states

Do NOT re-list enums or states

Do NOT include payout logic beyond blocking rules

Do NOT include score or tier systems

Write in English

Write in procedural rules, not summaries

Required Structure (Must Follow Exactly)
1. Purpose

Explain why upload verification and deadlines exist
(from an operational risk perspective).

2. Creator Actions (Actions Only)

List only actions a creator can perform, such as:

submit upload proof

resubmit proof (if allowed)

view verification result

Explicitly state:
Creators cannot directly change application states.

3. Upload Submission Rules

Define:

What counts as a valid submission

Required format per campaign type

When a submission is considered “received”

4. Verification Workflow (Step-by-Step)

Describe the exact sequence:

Submission received

Verification pending

Approved OR rejected

Optional resubmission

Final resolution

No state tables. Describe behavior.

5. Deadline Enforcement

Define:

Upload deadline

What happens at deadline

Automatic vs admin-triggered deadline_missed

Whether extensions are allowed and how

6. Terminal State Locking

Define:

Which states are terminal

What is forbidden after reaching a terminal state

No rollback rules

7. Failure & Edge Cases

Cover:

Invalid links

Private or deleted content

Late submissions

Content changes after approval

8. Safety Rules (Never Allowed)

Examples:

No verification without submission

No payout eligibility before verification approval

No state mutation after terminal state

9. Assumptions & Open Questions

List assumptions and decisions that must be confirmed later.

Final Instructions

This document must read like a rulebook for operators and developers

Do NOT restate PRD #1

Do NOT summarize the system

Focus ONLY on upload, verification, and deadlines

Generate the document now.
